The &#8220;world&#8221; model, which is a model representation of all the technical objects that make up the Eclipse SCADA system. And then there is the Component/Infrastructure model, which defines your technical infrastructure and the functional components that your system is made of.</p><p>The default process now is to create a Component/Infrastructure model and generate the world model from it. The worl model will then be transformed to deployable artifacts (configuration archive, .deb/.rpm packages, …).</p><h2 id="Globalization">Globalization</h2><p>Components, as defined in the component model, run on one or more &#8220;master servers&#8221;. So for example you define a script that outputs the current time as a string. This component is then assigned to master servers were is should run. Now it is possible to import the result into another master server. This is like a proxy component (or proxy item), since the functionality itself still is performed on the original master server. This process is called globalization. The master server containing globalized components is also sometimes called the &#8220;global server&#8221;, although it can host local components like a noermal master server.  </p><h1 id="Basicconfiguration">Basic configuration</h1><p>The following sections describe some basic configuration tasks.</p><h2 id="Createanewproject">Create a new project</h2><p>Create a new project using the &#8220;Create Project&#8221; wizard and create a new project of the type &#8220;Configuration Project&#8221; under the category &#8220;Eclipse SCADA Configuration&#8221;.</p><p>The default project will be filled with some nodes and some basic components.</p><h2 id="Createtheconfiguration">Create the configuration</h2><p>Right click on the &#8220;.recipe&#8221; file an select &#8220;Run Recipe&#8221; from the &#8220;Eclipse SCADA Configuration&#8221; sub-menu.</p><p>The configuration will be created in the same folder in the &#8220;output&#8221; folder that will be created.</p><p><em>Note</em> that the output folder will be deleted every time the recipe is run.</p><p>This will create a set of files inside the project. The most important for new are the two files called &#8220;world.escm&#8221; and &#8220;world.esim&#8221;. Which are the component model (escm) and the infrastructure model (esim).</p><p>The component model holds all components that the system is made of where the infrastructure model describes the technical infrastructure (like nodes, technical services, applications, deployments).</p><h2 id="Createsomedeploymentmechanism">Create some deployment mechanism</h2><p>In order to create ready to install .deb or .rpm packages you will need to add the deployment mechanism to the target node.</p><p>Select the SystemNode object, from the Infrastructure Model, that you would like to create packages for, right click and add either a Debian Deployment Descriptor or a Redhat Deployment Descriptor.</p><p>Be sure to fill out the maintainer field and create at least one change entry (child element). The maintainer can be referenced from the file called &#8220;deployment.information.esdi&#8221; that was created during project creation in the &#8220;global&#8221; folder. In order to assign the maintainer properly to the main element and the change entry element you will need to right click on some element of the infrastructure model and select &#8220;Load Resource…&#8221;. This will bring up a dialog which lets you choose how to load a resource. Select &#8220;Browse Workspace…&#8221; and select the file &#8220;global/deployment.information.esdi&#8221;. You can now select a maintainer from the list.</p><p>Running the recipe again will now create a .deb or .rpm file, depending on your configuration.</p><p><em>Note</em> you will need to have &#8220;debuild&#8221; or &#8220;rpmbuild&#8221; installed for actually creating packages. </p></body></html>
